## windowman
This project was conceived out of the fact that my dog is very anxious and tends to fixate on the people he sees out of our window (hence the big bad "window man"). The purpose of this project was to create a mechanism for us to programatically detect motion through a camera in hopes we could quickly know [when we need to give him a trea](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/training/operant-conditioning-positive-reinforcement-dog-training/)t. This script connects to an indoor Simplisafe camera and listens for motion detection events.



Created at Recurse Center's Impossible Day in March 2024.
